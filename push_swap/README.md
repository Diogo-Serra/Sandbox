## Description

Push_swap is an algorithmic project from the 42 curriculum.  
The objective is to sort a list of unique integers using **two stacks (a and b)** and a **restricted set of operations**, achieving the **lowest possible number of moves**.

The program `push_swap` receives a list of integers as arguments and outputs the shortest sequence of operations required to sort stack **a** in ascending order (smallest number at the top).

This project emphasizes algorithmic efficiency, time/space complexity analysis, and rigorous C programming.

## Instructions

### Compilation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Diogo-Serra/Sandbox/tree/main/push_swap push_swap
cd push_swap
make
```
### Usage
```bash
./push_swap 4 2 1 6 3 5
```
→ Displays the sequence of operations (one instruction per line).

## Resources & AI Usage

### References:

- Classic sorting algorithms and complexity analysis
- Stack operation theory and visualizations
- Community testers and visualizers

### AI usage:
- Used solely for generating random test cases, exploring edge-case scenarios, and visualizing sorting steps.
All algorithm design, implementation, optimization, and debugging were done manually, fully understood, and peer-reviewed.
